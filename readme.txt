DESCRIPTION:

SETUP:

The Python and Matlab commands to setup the solver executable (springs_setup.py and springs_setup.m, respectively) expect the GNU make and g++ commands to be accessible from the command prompt on your operating system.

	- Windows OS: We recommend MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/).  Be sure to add the MinGW\bin folder to your PATH environment variable.

	- Mac OS: Users may install XCode or just the command line developer tools (http://www.edparrish.net/common/macgpp.php).
